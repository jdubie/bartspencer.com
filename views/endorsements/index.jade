          p "I have known Bart Spencer for over a decade, since he was first employed as an Office of Emergency Services District Coordinator working throughout the County of San Mateo. During Bartâ€™s service on the Fire District Board, he has a proven record of accomplishment for prudent fiscal management that has allowed the District to maintain a high level of public safety services. I proudly support his candidacy for the Menlo Park Fire District."
